<title>Inspiring women through history example timeline</title>
 <!--Hello! This page contains a mixture of HTML (to structure the page), CSS (to style it) and JavaScript (to make it interactive).  I've used comments (like this one) throughout to explain what various bits do to link in and load the data from a spreadsheet stored in Google Docs, link in external script files, setup and draw the timeline and map onto the screen.  I've also used comments (look for the word 'try') to point out areas where you can experiment with changing the values in various bits of script, saving and re-loading the page to start putting the basics of programming into action.  The bulk of the code comes from http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/wiki/Timeline_GettingStarted or from Brian Croxall's example.  -->
 <!-- If you want to try changing the page, make a backup copy first so you can compare the two pages if you accidentally break something in the code. If you're on a Mac, TextEdit won't show you the raw code, you'll need to download another free tool like Smultron (http://sourceforge.net/projects/smultron/ for older Macs, http://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/ for newer Macs) or TextWrangler (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). Notepad will work on PCs, as will WordPad at a pinch but you can also try Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) -->
 <!-- If you want to try this code with your own spreadsheet, you can start by copying the one used in this example and putting your own values into the columns, or rename existing columns to match.  The names of columns are important because different bits of code use the names to identify specific bits of the rows of data.  You could also try changing the code to use your column names. -->
 <!-- Ok, on with the code! -->

<!-- The line below is your first bit of JavaScript. The <script></script> tags tell the browser we're not using HTML.  The 'src' bit tells the browser to import the code at that URL, which is the address of the JavaScript code on the SIMILE widgets site. -->
<script src="http://api.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/2.2.0/exhibit-api.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
 	
<!-- The line below tells the browser to import a specific script that manages all the functions needed to build a timeline.  This makes them available for us to actually build the timeline view further down the page. -->
<script src="http://api.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/2.2.0/extensions/time/time-extension.js"></script> 

<!-- The line below tells the browser to import all the functions needed to build a map. SIMILE uses Google Maps, which needs an API key - a string of characters a bit like a password - to work.  You can get your own API key by visiting the APIs Console at https://code.google.com/apis/console and logging in with a Google Account. When you have a key, replace the current messy string after 'gmapkey=' with your own key. Make sure you don't accidentally over-write the quote marks at the end! -->
<script src="http://api.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/2.2.0/extensions/map/map-extension.js?gmapkey=AIzaSyBc0Nd1kTvQ0o6jfK5LxYkZrqG_dKjOg_Q"></script>


<!-- The lines below tell the browser where the spreadsheet that holds the data is online.  If you want to use your own spreadsheet, you need to change the ID between '/list/' and '/od6/'. To find the ID (AKA the key) for your spreadsheet, choose the 'Publish to the web' option in Google Docs, then select 'Get a link to the published data' with the option 'RSS' selected. Copy that link and look for the ID in the address e.g. in 
https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0AhekQVhIO1pLdDVjeEc1WVpIc19SZC1QVURobU1JUHc/od6/public/basic?alt=rss. Make sure you don't accidentally copy over other bits of the address when you swap the keys. -->
<link 	rel="exhibit/data" 
      	type="application/jsonp"
      	href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0AhekQVhIO1pLdDVjeEc1WVpIc19SZC1QVURobU1JUHc/od6/public/basic?alt=json-in-script"
      	ex:converter="googleSpreadsheets" /> 
	
		
<!-- Now we'll start building the timeline. All the bits above have given us the raw ingredients we need, but it's up to us to make something with them! -->
<!-- If you're not sure how variables and functions work, now would be a good time to find out! You can also learn by changing values and seeing what happens if you don't mind that you'll sometimes break things. Don't forget to save different versions so you can go back and work out how to fix things. -->

<p>This timeline is populated dynamically with data served from a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AhekQVhIO1pLdDVjeEc1WVpIc19SZC1QVURobU1JUHc&output=html" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheet</a>. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16HAicl0D533cmGZQh3gt6941W0k-rcAw3r3KxBtPZCA/viewform">add new records about inspiring women in history yourself via this form</a>.  You can find women who could be listed from sites like <a href="http://www.womenaustralia.info/">the Australian Women's Register</a>, the <a href="http://adb.anu.edu.au/">The Australian Dictionary of Biography</a> (to start with). Tweet @mia_out if you have suggestions for other sites and I'll add them.</p>

<!-- This assigns colours to particular disciplines on the timeline, and sets a default colour for disciplines that aren't listed. The colours were chosen at http://colorschemedesigner.com/#3B61Tw0w0w0w0
It works with the code that lets the user select records for particular disciplines or countries. If you wanted to filter on different spreadsheet columns you could try swapping their names into the different places its references in the code on this page. -->
